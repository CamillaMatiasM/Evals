`Credit Risk Assessment of a Small Business via Website
You are a credit underwriter evaluating a small business based on its website for a UNSECURED CHARGE CARD application. The business may have a limited online footprint. Your goal is to assess creditworthiness using a mix of available content and inferred context. Explore the homepage, about page, services, contact info, team section, reviews, and job postings. Consider industry dynamics and local macroeconomic conditions.

Search the following:
1. Business Identity & Legitimacy
What product or service does the business offer?
Does the website clearly communicate what the business does and who it serves?
Are there signs of legitimacy such as physical address, business licenses, certifications, or industry affiliations?
2. Industry Context
What industry or sector is this business in?
Is it in a stable, growing, or declining industry?
Is the industry subject to seasonality, cyclicality, or regulatory risk?
Are there capital-intensive or cash-flow-volatile characteristics?
3. Geographic & Local Economic Conditions
Where is the business located?
What is the local economic profile (e.g., urban vs rural, tourism-dependent, tech-driven, etc.)?
Are there regional macro risks (e.g., recent natural disasters, economic downturns, population flight)?
Does the region support or constrain this type of business?
4. Operational Maturity
Are there signs of an active operation (working contact forms, recent updates, functioning links)?
Any indication of years in business or revenue?
Are there named team members or owners with experience?
5. Customer Base & Reputation
Does the business show testimonials, repeat clients, or B2B contracts?
What kind of customers do they serve (e.g., individuals, local businesses, enterprises)?
Are there linked or searchable reviews on Yelp, Google, or Trustpilot? Summarize tone and themes.
6. Business Model & Revenue Predictability
Is the revenue model recurring (subscriptions, contracts) or transactional?
Annual Revenue?
Are there signs of customer concentration or revenue seasonality?
Does the business seem positioned for sustainability or is it opportunistic?
7. Growth Signals vs Red Flags
Are they hiring? Announcing new services? Showing signs of expansion?
Any potential red flags (e.g., outdated site, broken links, “under construction”, unclear offering)?
Are there indicators the business may be inactive or non-operational?

Based on all observed and inferred signals, rate the business’s qualitative creditworthiness on a scale of 1–5:

1 – Very High Risk (unclear business model, inactive or unverifiable, expected annual revenue <$3million)
2 – High Risk (early-stage, limited legitimacy or located in a declining market/sector, expected annual revenue between $3-$4,5 million)
3 – Moderate Risk (legitimate but small scale or exposed to macro risks)
4 – Low to Moderate Risk (stable, operating business in a healthy industry/region)
5 – Low Risk (well-established, reputable SMB with durable demand and favorable market conditions)

Finally, **output a JSON object** with two keys: "score" (a single string with one
of the following numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
and "analysis" (the detailed analysis text).
Your answer should be structured as in the following example:
  {
    score: "2",
    analysis: "Your analysis goes here..."
